# üõû ABS_PID_Model

A single-wheel Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) built in **OpenModelica**, using a **PID-based slip control** strategy and realistic **slip-peak tire friction**.  
The library is modular, reusable, and designed for educational and research use.

---

## üöó Overview

The model simulates a **single-wheel ABS** where brake torque is actively controlled to maintain an optimal slip ratio (~0.2).  
It includes subsystems for the wheel, vehicle body, controller, actuator, driver input, and road friction ‚Äî each written as a reusable Modelica class.

The simulation can represent:
- Braking on **constant-friction (dry)** surfaces.
- **Dry ‚Üí wet** transitions (Œº drop) with dynamic torque capping.
- Optional **visual block diagram** in OMEdit for demonstration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1. Open `package.mo` in **OMEdit** or **OpenModelica**.
2. Load the library:  
   `File ‚Üí Open Model/Library ‚Üí ABS_PID_Model/package.mo`
3. Simulate one of the systems:
   - `ABS_PID_Model.ABSSystem` ‚Äì constant dry road.
   - `ABS_PID_Model.ABSSystem_MuStep` ‚Äì dry ‚Üí wet transition at 2 s.
4. Plot:
   - `wheel.slipRatio`
   - `T_b`, `Troad_max`
   - `mu`
   - `vehicleBody.vehicleSpeed` and `wheel.wheelSpeed*wheel.Rw`

## üß© Model Summary

| **Model** | **Description / Function** | **Key Equations / Logic** | **Main Assumptions** | **Purpose** |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **VehicleBody.mo** | Quarter-vehicle longitudinal model; computes vehicle velocity under braking. | \( m \cdot \dot{v} = -F_x \) | No drag, slope, or tire compliance. Constant mass. | Provides vehicle speed feedback to other subsystems. |
| **Wheel.mo** | Rotational dynamics of a single wheel; computes angular velocity and slip ratio. | \( J \cdot \dot{\omega} = T_b - F_x R_w \); \( Œª = (v - œâR_w)/v \) | Rigid tire; constant normal load; no lateral slip. | Converts brake torque into slip ratio for ABS control. |
| **PIDController.mo** | Closed-loop slip controller regulating wheel slip around target value. | \( T_{cmd} = K_p e + K_i \int e + K_d \dot{e} \) | Continuous-time; ideal sensors; includes anti-windup and torque saturation. | Adjusts braking torque to maintain optimal slip (‚âà0.2). |
| **BrakeActuator.mo** | First-order dynamic brake actuator; converts pedal signal to torque. | \( T = \frac{T_{max} u}{1 + sœÑ} \) | Linear hydraulic response; no hysteresis. | Simulates brake pressure delay and limit. |
| **DriverPedalRamp.mo** | Driver input model; ramp from 0 to 1 simulating pedal press. | Linear ramp: \( u(t) = (t-t_0)/T \) | Smooth pedal application; no release phase. | Provides consistent driver input for testing. |
| **RoadFrictionSlipPeak.mo** | Slip-dependent tire-road friction model with single peak. | \( Œº(Œª)=Œº_p(|Œª|/Œª_p)e^{1-|Œª|/Œª_p} \) | Friction depends only on slip ratio; constant Œº_peak, Œª_peak. | Represents tire behavior on a uniform road (dry). |
| **RoadFrictionSlipPeakStep.mo** | Same as above, but Œº_peak changes at a defined time (dry‚Üíwet). | Œº scales by smooth tanh step at \( t = t_{step} \). | Uniform friction drop; smooth transition (œÑ smoothing). | Tests controller stability during road condition change. |
| **RoadFrictionStep.mo** | Simple constant Œº with step change (no slip dependency). | \( Œº = Œº_1 \) or \( Œº_2 \) depending on time. | Idealized two-level road friction. | Early testing of torque limiting and event handling. |
| **ABSSystem.mo** | Integrates all subsystems (PID, wheel, body, actuator, constant Œº road). | Combines dynamics + torque limiter \( T_{b} ‚â§ R_w Œº_p F_z \) | One wheel; constant Œº; no coupling effects. | Baseline ABS system ‚Äî constant surface. |
| **ABSSystem_MuStep.mo** | Full ABS with Œº step (dry‚Üíwet) using adaptive torque cap. | Uses `RoadFrictionSlipPeakStep` for dynamic Œº_peak. | Road friction changes mid-simulation. | Tests adaptation under friction change. |
| **ABSSystem_Block.mo** | Same as ABSSystem but with layout annotations for OMEdit diagram. | Visual only (no equation change). | ‚Äî | For schematic visualization and training use. |

## üåç Global Modeling Assumptions

| **Aspect** | **Assumption** |
|:--|:--|
| Vehicle model | Single-wheel (¬º vehicle) representation. |
| Motion | Longitudinal only; no lateral or pitch effects. |
| Load | Constant vertical load \( F_z = m g / 4 \). |
| Friction | Œº depends only on slip ratio; no velocity or temperature dependence. |
| Brake actuator | Linear first-order system; no hysteresis. |
| Controller | Continuous PID; no sampling or quantization. |
| Sensors | Perfect (no noise, delay, or bias). |
| Terrain | Flat road; no gradient or aerodynamic drag. |

## üß† Key Takeaways

- The ABS maintains slip ratio near **0.15‚Äì0.20**, maximizing tire-road friction.  
- When road Œº drops, the controller **automatically reduces torque** to avoid wheel lockup.  
- The modular structure makes it easy to extend:
  - Add multi-wheel dynamics,
  - Include weight transfer,
  - Replace PID with fuzzy logic or MPC.
